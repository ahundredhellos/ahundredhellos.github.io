	<h1>It all begins with "Hello".</h1>
<p>The way to growth is doing what is uncomfortable. And what better way to be uncomfortable than to put myself out there in front of attractive women?</p>
<p>I've always preoccupied myself with how I'm viewed by others, fearing their judgement. I thought that I had to look, act, and basically live a certain way in order to get approval. My confidence stemmed from external rather than internal sources - it's no wonder that I never had much experience with girls throughout high school and college. Out of fear of rejection, I only acted when I knew it was a sure bet, playing it safe. After going through many interviews to find a job out of college and getting turned down many times, I grew number to the pang of rejection and I'm applying it in the form of social interactions with the other gender.</p>
<p>My experiment consists of&nbsp;<strong>100&nbsp;</strong>authentic interactions with the people who make me nervous - women I am attracted to. I'll be doing this with a mixture of&nbsp;<strong>direct</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>indirect</strong> openers, be it telling them straightforwardly that I think they are cute and I came to say hi, or commenting on the surrounding environment. I'll be documenting all of my interactions, and I will only count ones where we've had any sort of interaction. If I walk up to someone and she immediately exits the conversation, it will only be recorded as miscellaneous and not count. I'll also be documenting any sort of meetups that I'm able to arrange from the new friends I make, as well as what I learned through this experience.</p>
<p>The goal here is to learn through the journey and not fixate on the results. I know the pang of being turned down, but also the condolence of reflecting on the situation to learn from it and not berate myself. I seek to better myself through interacting with strangers and stepping out of my comfort zone. Follow me on my journey.</p>
