<div class="blurb">
	<h1>It all begins with "Hello".</h1>
<p>You introduce yourself, and they reply back. You continue the conversation, revealing more about yourself in an unconditional manner, staying in the moment that you and they share. Perhaps a connection has formed, or perhaps not. Regardless, this interaction between two people was initiated by a simple "hello".</p>
		
<p><strong>The way to growth is doing what is uncomfortable</strong>. And what better way to be uncomfortable than to put myself out there to talk to girls?</p>
	
<p>This is my fight to get what I want.</p>	

	<p><strong>Caught Up In Past Hindrances</strong></p>	
	
<p>I've always preoccupied myself with how I'm viewed by others, fearing their judgement. I thought that I had to present myself in a certain way in order to get approval. I was a people-pleaser hiding behind a mask.</p>
	
	
<p>My confidence stemmed from external rather than internal sources - it's no wonder that I never had much experience with girls throughout high school and college. Out of fear of rejection, I only acted when I knew it was a sure bet, and even when there were signs of interest from the other party, I still refrained from taking any action. After all, I thought I would <strong>never miss</strong> if I just didn't take any shots. Ultimately, I <strong>do miss</strong> all of the shots that I don't take.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Getting Back Up After Falling Down</strong></p>
<p>After going through many interviews to find a job out of college and getting turned down many times, I grew number to the pang of rejection and I'm applying it in the form of social interactions with the other gender.</p>
	
<p>My experiment consists of&nbsp;<strong>100&nbsp;</strong>authentic interactions with the people who make me nervous - women I am attracted to. I'll be doing this with a mixture of&nbsp;<strong>direct</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>indirect</strong> openers, be it telling them straightforwardly that I think they are cute and I came to say hi, or commenting on the surrounding contexts. I'll be documenting all of my interactions on what I did to initiate the conversation, the ensuing process of the interaction, and then what I learned from the experience. From the dates or other meetups that result to the stumbles I make, this site will have it all. After I make all 100 approaches, I will share the conclusions that I draw.</p>
	
<p>The goal here is to learn through the journey and not fixate on the results. I know the pang of being turned down, but also the condolence of reflecting on the situation to become better for next time. It's better to fail early and fail often, and I have nothing to lose. I seek to better myself through casting aside my ego to create genuine interactions with strangers. Follow me on my journey.</p>
