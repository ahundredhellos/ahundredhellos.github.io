I’m not doing my project just to get laid. While I do enjoy the “chase”, I’m not expecting much in terms of getting any spectacular results. What keeps me going is my purpose. I’m conducting an experiment where each interaction I have is a trial, and after each trial, I collect, analyze and then apply the data for next time. Through my work, I seek to prove self-development starts with trying, grow myself by stepping out of my comfort zone, and encourage others to try something bold.
 
If I were to put myself on the spectrum between spontaneous and calculated, I place myself right in the middle. When I make travel plans, instead of carefully crafting an itinerary with an exact schedule or completely winging it, I research a few top points of interest and then make impromptu agendas to see them the night before. If there are any setbacks perhaps due to the weather, I adjust the plan accordingly while still managing to see at least a few of the destinations on the list. 
 
Taking this approach to putting myself out there in front of women, I think, “what do I have to lose?” Yes, it takes energy to strike up conversations, but it’s nowhere near as much as if I were to worry about impressing the few girls I match with on Tinder or Bumble using the perfect pickup line, a method akin to reading countless books on basketball techniques while only taking let’s say five shots per day. The alternative I take would be to take many more shots per day, because I could never score if I didn’t take the shot. Sometimes I score, and sometimes I miss. More importantly, I learn something from each time, helping me figure out what I could improve on. When I revisit my notes to put them into the spreadsheet, I play back each encounter in my head to honestly assess what happened. I then translate that data into my content, allowing more room for reflection.
 
Rewinding awkward moments where I accidentally talk to a woman that is married, get brushed off, or just mess up helps to expand my comfort zone. Before getting rejected by them on the street, I’ve been rejected by girls in high school as well as college - the difference between now and then is how I handle the outcomes. 
 
During the spring semester of my junior year, I had a crush on a girl in my economics class. After looking at her from afar, I once ran into her at a club event and we started talking, leading me to eventually ask her out for coffee. That afternoon, after sending my message, I felt my heart racing fast. Anxiously waiting for her response, I could not control myself from checking my phone. With all of the nervous energy, I even set a personal record for my deadlifts that day at the gym! Amidst my workout, I got her response (“sure!”) and finished my workout session in a giddy mood. I then had a very awkward date with her due to my nervousness. To my chagrin, once summer break finished and I asked her if she wanted to catch up, I was turned down. I became so caught up in trying to impress her to change her mind that I’d sometimes go to the same school club events in order to hopefully strike up a conversation, but that never happened even when I saw her there as I was too invested. It was no surprise that it did not work out.
 
I was too dependent on the outcome and not on the process. Now, I’ve done 17 approaches and have gone on 1 date. And I’m doing fine because of my abundance mindset. There are girls out there that would be willing to talk to me, and there are ones that are not. I’m not going to change myself for the sake of pleasing somebody else, and so I am able to fully put myself out there. Thus, if an interaction with a girl does not go well, that is fine for me. I have 83 more tries for the remainder of this project and a whole lot more down the road. 
 
There is still so much left for me to do as my project is 17% complete. What I’m working on is setting aside my ego. In addition to the girls I speak to who will have their opinions of me, I’m sure their friends, as well as bystanders who happen to hear, all notice what is going on and have their thoughts about it. That does not matter to me - I’m just an average height 22-year old Asian guy who is trying to get what he wants. I’m putting my data out there to let everyone see how I fare in my adventure as a resource to those considering using this approach in interacting with people. This is an effort to paint the most realistic picture possible of a young Asian male in New York City. Obviously, your mileage may vary and I encourage you all to share with me your experiences. Send me an email to connect and we can go from there - we are all in this together in the age of technology in a quest to form genuine relationships!
