I'm sure we all know the many different ways of interacting with women, but let me break them all down starting from the most weak-level ties to the strongest links, along with what's necessary to get them.

<strong>1 - Fun only: Tinder, hookups from online dating, one-night stands from going out to bars and clubs</strong>

These interactions are only for fun, it doesn't matter if you don't want to be in their presence the next morning because you soon won't remember their name. Flirting, seduction, it's two people in a dance of attraction to get a night of passion, an exchange of two bodies close together yet two personalities so far; superficiality, only brushing the surface of getting to know each other. Rinse and repeat, for there are a great many seeking the same.

<strong>1.5 - Explicitly conveying intent in-person </strong>

It's the Tinder of real-life. Signaling to women how you are also a sexual creature, and how you can fulfull her sexual desires. Making eye contact just long enough to see the color of their eyes.
