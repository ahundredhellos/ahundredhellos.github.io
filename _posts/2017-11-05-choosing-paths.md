I'm sure we all know the many different ways of interacting with women, but let me break them all down starting from the most weak-level ties to the strongest links, along with what's necessary to get them.

<strong>1 - Fun only: Tinder, hookups from online dating, one-night stands from going out to bars and clubs</strong>

These interactions are only for fun, it doesn't matter if you don't want to be in their presence the next morning because you won't remember their name soon. Flirting, seduction, it's two people in a dance of attraction to get a night of passion, an exchange of two bodies close together yet two personalities so far; superficiality, only brushing the surface of getting to know each other. Rinse and repeat, for there are a great many seeking the same.

Example: Present-day pop culture

<strong>1.5 - Explicitly conveying sexual intent in-person </strong>

It's the Tinder of real-life. Signaling to women how you are also a sexual creature, and how you can fulfill her sexual desires. Making eye contact just long enough to see the color of their eyes. Speaking with a tone of strong conviction, "I want you and you want me, we both know it so why play games?". But alas, this is a temporary affair, an ephemeral, discrete situation.

Example: Zan Perrion in his book "The Alabaster Girl"

<strong>2 - Direct approach: Authentic relay of interest and vulnerability </strong>

Similar to the above situation, except this time it's not one of solely sexual pursuits. It's about taking an interest in the woman as a person, presenting yourself to her while simultaneously checking to see if she is right for you and whatever situation you are in. There is no need to play games, for your interest in her has already been signaled through the initial approach (and they know). It's all up to her to take it or leave it, for there are so many people out there. Note: you should let your intentions be known before escalating for this is what is truly representative of genuine relationships.

Example: Mark Manson in his book "Models: Attract Women Through Honesty"

<strong>3 - Start off as friends </strong>

No expectations whatsoever, solely enjoying the presence of the woman without the sex and intimacy. Sure this is possible, isn't it basically the same as hanging out with a guy? You wouldn't want to have sex with your guy friends right? 

You may say that attraction is the biggest difference here, so let me say that the solution would then be to not fixate on this one girl. If you have other options, that takes off the sexual pressure and you can develop the friendship naturally with her. This can even lead to a relationship - one whose strength is built from the foundation of friendship.

<strong>Setting Expectations</strong>

Now comes the breakdown. You get what you put in, and if you want one thing but find that it's not natural for you to do it, then think if it is what you really want and if yes, then there are no excuses, you just have to "do". Each number is reflective of the situation from above.

1 - random hookups are like a dance, if you don't want to "dance" to entertain the girl in order to get her body, then you most likely won't be able to unless she is that attracted to you physically.

1.5 - can you signal the sexual interest, the real reason why you are talking to her? This is extremely hard (I have never done this before) and Zan Perrion makes it sound so easy in his book.

2 - this is akin to throwing darts while blindfolded. You never know what might hit (when you two will click) but you still have to keep throwing amidst the rejections.

3 - don't be attached to someone who you are supposedly friends with. Just because you are friends doesn't entitle you to her. This is why you can't be a nice guy, you have to be a masculine guy.

Hopefully this gives some direction. Know what to expect and then make an educated decision.
