I like having good conversations. I like them even better when the person I’m conversing with is a cute girl who is polite, engaged in the conversation, and fun to talk to - completely opposite from the ones that immediately brush me off without saying a word.
 
I was feeling a little discouraged today because of my hesitance and feelings of lack of confidence. However, my last approach of the day turned out to be a great experience, and these types of encounters make my one hundred hellos a much more rewarding process. There was absolutely no expectations whatsoever in doing my approach as I just wanted to get another one in on my own before going to work on my other projects. Little did I expect it to turn out the way it did.
 
There stood a girl waiting at the crosswalk dressed in very noticeable clothing, or should I say revealing. Her pink shorts were barely long enough to cover her behind, which did a great job in revealing her slender legs, further accentuated by a pair of bright red slip-ons. I noticed her even from quite far away, and she piqued my interest. Walking closer, I began forming plans on how to talk to her without being too conspicuous, which caused me to hope that the three other people in front of me would go away.
 
Luckily, they did! The coast was clear but I was feeling very self-conscious of the booksellers that were right beside us. Deciding to lay low, I followed her for a period that seemed like an eternity until we passed them and approached a wider sidewalk. I walked up to her from the left, turned to face her, and said “excuse me, I know this is completely random but I thought you were cute and I wanted to say hi”.
 
Her face lit up with a small smile, and she said thanks. Defaulting to the situational rambling, I asked if she was just hanging around the park and how there seemed to be some stuff going on there. She replied with a short “yes”, and I followed up by telling her about my plan to go into the library when I saw her, which that opened her up.
 
We talked for quite a bit and covered many subjects, and I found out that she was on vacation to NYC from Hong Kong, traveling by herself. Although she was older by maybe two or three years, she still had a playful vibe and teased me about why I was going to the library on a Saturday night. Showing some vulnerability herself, she also mentioned how she met up with a bunch of people already in New York, one of them being her ex-boyfriend. I learned that they broke up because of location logistics, which makes sense, and also her thoughts on what I can do to actually work on something that I’m passionate about for my job. 
 
It felt like I was interacting with a big sister. No, there was not much of a sexual vibe but that might have been different if I had tighter game. The conversation resonated with me because of it’s authenticity. This girl (my 41st approach) was on vacation and would not be seeing me again. So, she shared openly with me and I with her. A fleeting conversation, one where the two will never see the other again. 
 
Now it’s up to me to create these types of connections with people that are not tourists (haha!). If the connection is there, then I’m confident that there will not be any need to play games. Today’s interaction gives me hope, that even when things weren’t looking so good, somehow something good came out of another try - another try, try, try until I find that other person.
