4 months. 101 approaches. 13 contacts. 1 date. 

Those were the numbers, but what's not shown is the man behind those numbers. I can say that this was <strong>one of the most memorable experiences of my life</strong> - to be able to face inhibition, the gatekeeper to what I wanted, head-on and make battle.

<strong>Background of the Project</strong>

I'll save a discussion about myself for a later post but I'll say that I grew up socially awkward, and had absolutely zero experience with girls until college. And even there I didn't do much, preferring to stay inside to play video games or hang out with friends who were similar to me. All the while, I had the thought of self-improvement and did try, but nothing to the magnitude of a hundred hellos.

Therefore, I was quite obviously shocked when I witnessed, three years ago, a former friend of mine go up to a girl, talk to her, and then get her number. Observing the interaction, I thought to myself, "this is crazy, I'd <strong>never</strong> do such a thing like that", but look at me now!

Approaching girls was not completely new to me when I started this project - I'd done some a few months prior and even went on two dates, but I was always with my friend when doing them. I had to be pushed, and even challenged with a bet one time: we'd each stake $15 and if we didn't do five approaches during the time limit, the other person would get the money. This time, my one hundred hellos is an independent project with no force. I set the objective, and though it was hard at times, I persevered.

<strong>Thoughts Along The Way</strong>

Going in strong, I luckily got my first date from the first girl I approached...which turned out to be the only date I'd go on during the whole project. That may sound like a shame, but it made me come to a huge realization that <strong>it was hard when doing a take-it-or-leave-it approach</strong>. I was being the real me, not someone putting on a show to get inside girls' pants. This was hard and lead me to some lows due to the lack of the results on the surface. But that changed through the people I met along the way, which made it all the more worth it to continue. 

It was as if for every ten approaches I did, one of them would be a great interaction - I just had to keep rolling the dice. Not to make a pun out of it, but I had to be "in the game" and be a "player" to see any results instead of being a bystander. Plus, what did I have to lose? I had nothing to lose but my pride. 

Overall, this was <strong>an exercise in being uncomfortable</strong>, an approach that is like <strong>throwing darts at a dartboard while blindfolded</strong>, and a <strong>faith-filled experience</strong> (but not in the religious sense, you'll see what I mean).

Initially, I was so hesitant to talk to a girl and tell her what I thought (that she was cute and wanted to say "hi") that I made up every excuse in the book to escape. "What if she has a boyfriend?" "She looks like she's in a rush". "She'll never go for me". Now, whenever I see someone I like, I spring to get the chance to know her.

<strong>Desensitization</strong> made the uncomfortable and unpleasant much easier to deal with, but in order to become this way, I had to get acquainted with the opposite. That meant experiencing the whole gamut of negative reaction: there have been times when I've been completely ignored - the girl would keep walking without slowing down at all, making me feel like a stalker for having to immediately having to turn around and walk away amidst the crowds of people in New York City. There have also been times when the girls shut me down instantly, making a sharp turn away from me in order to avoid the random guy who talked to them on the streets. 

After encountering these situations, soft rejections such as "sorry", or "I already have a boyfriend" don't seem as bad. Being turned down is not the end of the world, and as I've already approached over 100 women, I know that there are plenty of girls out there for me. It's up to me to find the right one. (look up abundance vs. scarcity mindset, great stuff)

Finding the right <strong>fit</strong> is important. My way of filtering was extremely easy as I did the cold approach, walking up to talk to them as a stranger on the street. A term that denotes the unknown, but typically associated with the unsafe, "stranger" invokes actions of avoid, avoid, avoid - not engage. I'd like to think that any girl who actually stops to have a conversation with me is more open-minded than the average person, and I don't attribute this to the innocent look I give off, but moreso to the actual strange happenings that do occur in New York City. Even given the assumption of safety, some girls immediately write me off as a player or a pickup artist, even though that is far from what I desire to be. A girl that stops to speak with me is thus someone like me, who would be interested in exploring the "stranger", the unknown.

Yet, to start the discovery into another person is only the beginning for there must be <strong>compatibility</strong>. In being myself, I reveal my background, insecurities, and interests to show my personality. In turn, the girl does the same in this dance of courtship. Such a ritual will most likely lead to nothing rather than something, for both people have to be interested and like each other for a friendship or relationship to form, which I experienced firsthand on my single date of the 101 approaches. Sure, we had fun, but I felt little commonalities between us, meaning it would be hard to even be good friends with each other. 

A funnel thus serves as the image to convey the message of the numbers game. For every girl that I approach, only some will want to talk to me, and of those, a lesser number will want to exchange contact information. Fewer girls will want to go on a date with me, and think of how many will go on more? This looks like a problem but it is not. <strong>Once I hit gold, I will hit GOLD</strong>. I just have to be in the game.

I am a person of faith. That one day, I will meet the right person who will <strong>want me for ME</strong>. Until that day comes, I will keep striving to be the best person that I can be, work on what I'm passionate about, and serve in whichever ways I can. It is hard dealing with uncertainty, but as Thomas Paine puts it, <strong>"The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph"</strong>.

<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>
This is a call to action to live life actively. If you've gotten this far, I'm sure you must be engaged and so I will go a little deeper.

I wrote this because I was sick and tired of being a "nice guy" who hoped that being nice would be the key to a woman's heart, sitting idly by playing video games, watching Netflix, and watching other types of videos ;) to get by while fantasizing of meeting my dream girl one day. Green with envy looking at the popular guys, the rich men, and the successful males being with beautiful women.

Life came and gave me a major whooping, shattering me but also allowing myself to rebuild. An acceptance of the situation I'm in and a willingness to change, to learn from my mistakes, started a serious introspection within myself. I wondered when I was happiest: when I was doing what I loved. There is absolutely no need to fake confidence, charm, or swagger in such a state. Only the opposite act of being natural, using what you were given to the fullest extent to be the best person you can be.

Do what you are passionate about and the right person will come.
