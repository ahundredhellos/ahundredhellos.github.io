Actual Date - May 18, 2017 (publication date is 6/1/17):

I can’t believe I’m back in the game already after a 8-month hiatus. I also can’t believe how quickly everything happened in getting a contact and then a date from her (see first post under dates). Perhaps this is a kind way for me to ease into the long road ahead of me in my self-development. Or could it be the gift of latent development, where I see the results of the past few months - results that were previously indirect, now coming into light?
 
Who knows and over-analysis will only lead me to wrack my brains more. All I should do is take everything into consideration and then learn from it for my later activities. 
 
It all began on Thursday. After being pumped from a festival, an alumni mingle, and finally a banker party at a rooftop bar. Not seeing much from either of these places, I went with my friend to Bryant Park in preparation for checking out Circle, an Asian nightclub. We walked around a bit and he tried to open two girls who were taking a selfie, but that didn’t work. However, he did find success with a girl sitting by herself, leaving me wandering around for a little to give him time to close. 
 
Walking by myself, I quickly scanned the area. I noticed a few girls sitting down but I was a little nervous and I used the justification that they were not as attractive to me in order to not approach. I did not think of doing any action, even when I noticed the two girls whom I eventually approached. 
 
This changed when my friend thought about approaching another girl after we left the park. I made up my mind - if the two girls were still there, then I’d go for it. It eventually worked, because despite my initial extreme hesitation, I just felt the energy of “the chase” inside of me and went to say hi. 
 
The two girls were indeed there, sitting on chairs facing the NYPL. One of the girls was on the phone and caused me to second-guess my approach, but I did it nevertheless to her friend who was free. I approached with an energy and started by saying that this was random but I saw her when I was at the fountain and thought she was cute so I came to say “hi”. She smiled back, leading the way for me to introduce myself to her. I began to ramble on a bit about the Empire State building and how it was nice to be in Bryant Park at night to enjoy the atmosphere and she simply assented. To push the conversation further, I asked if she lived in NYC and she replied that she was here for her friend’s college graduation. In response, I recalled with nostalgia my own college graduation, which was around a year ago. 
 
After creating more pieces of conversation for her to pick up on, she asked about what I did and I briefly mentioned how I am working in the city and have been to a lot of places but that there is still more to see in NYC. We joked around a bit about driving in NYC and the conversation went well overall, but not enough to the point where I felt completely confident to ask for her number. Nevertheless, I decided to go for it and pulled out my phone, asking “maybe we can get coffee sometime”. She hesitated a second so I suggested Facebook, which she agreed to. I got her contact, and wished them a good night.
