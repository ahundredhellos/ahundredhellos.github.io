Actual date: 6/20/2017

Before my one approach from today, I’ve gotten 5 contacts from 30 approaches but have only gone on 1 date. I might have had a chance with three to set up a date, but all of them didn’t work and here’s why.
 
The first girl was my 23rd approach and we had a pretty good interaction when we first met. I walked up to her and she was quite happy, and she specifically pointed out how random she thought this was but seemed to enjoy it. When I asked for her number to “hang out”, she readily gave it and told me to text her, which I did. What followed were a few back-and-forth exchanges on the night we first met, me asking about her and vice-versa. What it lacked though was excitement, which I tried to bring one night later by telling her a story of an exciting Citibike ride I had while going to watch the NBA finals. It seemed like she wanted to text me more but she didn’t, so I left it at that and the next night (third night) I asked if she wanted to get dinner later in the week, to which I got no response.
 
The second girl was the one in which I should have played hard to get. She was pretty hot and I’m sure she got a lot of attention, so she didn’t text me too enthusiastically. It was only after I sent a clever line (in my opinion) commenting on how hard it was to work with barely any info on her did she respond, and then only on and off. It seemed like I just typed too much in my responses to her, and now I know that it’s best to just match her responses in terms of length to not seem too excited.
 
On the other hand, I played too hard to get with the third girl (my 30th approach) when I should have texted in a platonic way. This girl was quite cute and responsive, but I ended up being too unresponsive and she eventually got bored of me. There was absolutely no need to wait so long for me to text her and I should not have thought so hard on what to type - I most likely could have been pretty chill with her and it would have been completely fine! 
 
I went from three possible dates to zero and part of it is because of my texting. The other part of it is definitely uncontrollable, because who knows if the girl has already gotten bored of me, was talked out of texting me by a friend, or had second thoughts and labeled me a player. It’s too random to tell, and I can’t let it get to me. But it does get to me because of how few data points I have with only really three numbers that I had to work with. 
 
In the end, even though I’m already 1/3rd the way through my approaches, I’m just beginning to interact via texting and getting dates. I will put a lot of this up to chance in terms of how they all go and the only thing I can do is push on and meet new people.
