description: keep going, unexpected, maximizing time, approaching

Tues, Sept 26, 2017

Something happened to me completely out of the blue. I got a message from a girl I approached three months ago (see row 43 of spreadsheet) and we started talking from there. Taken by surprise, I assumed it was a sign of interest and played it cool, messaging her in a way completely devoid of any attempts to impress - a strategy that worked out even better than expected.

After a few exchanges here and there, she asked if I wanted to grab drinks. This was the first time a girl I approached messaged me to set something up, and I gladly obliged. 

We had a great time, but more importantly, I came to a <strong>realization</strong> that makes me want to point this out: when on the grind, don’t have expectations except the willingness to work hard.

To put it into perspective, I approached over 100 women and got one date if you exclude what happened unexpectedly. Not a problem at all, as I would have gone on zero dates if I hadn’t tried, gotten shut down many times, and learned from these trials. Despite all of the setbacks, I kept going for each attempt was a chance; fortune favors the bold.

There are so many factors that are out of your control that affect a girl’s opinion of you that it’s just not worth it to get overly caught up in the results. Take a look at her friends, the major gatekeepers to her heart. During the date, she told me that she asked her friends what they thought of the situation of a random guy approaching her on the street, and they thought that I didn’t look suspicious so why not go for it. See, it’s not only your actions that influence the girl, but also the thoughts of her friends, which you cannot do anything about. Did you remind one of them of a lousy ex? Or of that terrible tinder date? Then kiss your odds of getting the girl goodbye.

<strong>What can you do?</strong>

Control what you can. My date asked me why I talked to girls like this, suggesting that I was no stranger to cold approaching and I answered with three main points, fit exactly for the lifestyle that I lead.

I have <strong>limited time</strong> and thus it’s not very efficient to go to social events such as mixers at bars, entertainment events including concerts, and other happenings of NYC. Instead, I maximize the time I have when out and about by approaching the girls that I pass by along the way. This means meeting people on my way to networking events, running errands, and hanging out with friends (I go to where we are set to meet a little early or stay a bit later to see who I can find). 

When I talk to a lot of people, I’ll meet a variety of different personalities and will only connect with some. In having the conversation, I try to view it as an exploration, whether I’d like to get to know this girl better or not rather than if I can get some action or not, for <strong>natural connection</strong> is very important to me. In working a day job while also trying to create something, my mind is always thinking. Hanging out with girls should thus be fun and not stressful, I’ve had enough of that - I just want to be myself.

A self that will get along with some but not others, I have to <strong>keep going</strong>. There are so many more encounters to be had, fun times to share, and memories to create on this journey. The best thing to do would be to view them as bonuses along the way, for I savor the ride.
