The serenity prayer written by Reinhold Niebuhr goes: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. In playing “the game”, I’m accepting the fact that there is a lot of randomness at play, oftentimes leading to awkward moments. Other times, when I can control my actions but make a small mistake, I have my “facepalm” moments. I’ve made a bunch of blunders so far but I persevere because the rewards are too great to dissuade me.
 
Now I’m no psychic and I can’t tell fully tell what state a girl is in when I approach her. She may have a boyfriend, speak little English, or happen to not be in the mood to talk. However, she may be receptive and want to talk to this guy who thinks she is cute. There is only one way to find out, and that is to start a conversation.
 
For my ninth misc approach, I walked up to two girls both wearing full black and commented on their outfits. Casting one glance at me, then glancing at her friend, the girl nearest to me looked back with a small smile but also a wave to brush me off, departing into the distance with her friend.
 
These girls knew what I was up to, ending the conversation in an instant. For other instances, I try to veil my intentions by sending out “feelers” to gauge their interest instead of directly indicating mine. I’d ask innocent questions such as where to get to a certain location, or ask about something that they are carrying such as a shopping bag. After seeing their reaction, I’d decide if I wanted to push it or not. From my fifth and ninth misc approaches, it did not look like they wanted to engage in further conversation. And that is fine with me.
 
By veiling my intentions, I’ve also been able to avoid some extremely awkward situations when appearance did not match reality. This is to say that I’ve made some bad judgement calls on who to talk to - I walked up to a group of women in Times Square for my sixth misc approach after taking a glance at them but when I started a conversation with one by saying “excuse me”, I realized that she was much older than I thought she was! Another time, I went up to this cute girl sitting on a bench near St. Marks and after getting a closer look, I noticed that she was married. It was too late to bail, and I escaped by hiding my intentions to the first group by asking if they wanted a group photo and then rambling about how cool Times Square was. To the married women, I stumbled through asking directions, wondering “do you know where THE Washington Square Park is?” 
 
Slinking away from these mishaps, the awkwardness hit me for a brief moment but then came a feeling of accomplishment. Yes, I probably had the other party think of me as some weird, awkward guy who came up to talk to them, but at least I’m not in the running for the most memorable characters of NYC. They will soon forget about me but I will not forget them because I saw what I (thought I) wanted and then made an effort to go get it. 
 
I screw up, but I try to learn from my mistakes. It’s more important to just go for it, striving to maintain desire without attachment, execution above outcome.
