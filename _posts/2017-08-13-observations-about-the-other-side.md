You have to get your sh*t together. Then can you fully enjoy the fruits of your labor. How can you maintain healthy
relationships with other people if you can't do it with yourself? 

**Establish a routine and have that special someone as a plus. Don't change your life to revolve around him or her.**

We attract what we are - if someone is in a frantic, disorganized state, then he or she will find someone similar.
On the other hand, if an individual has his or her life put together, then the person they attract will be the same.

Plus, if one were to try to maintain multiple relationships at the same time, the level of energy spent balancing everything
will be even greater, not to mention the typical matters of school, work, friendships, and health that need attention. It is
thus much more efficient to have your own life in place before trying to romantically interact with other people. That way,
you will know who you are, what you want, and can unabashedly express those desires in an authentic manner.

Authenticity is developed over time and we are all in different stages, just like the 77 women I've met so far during my
approaches. Some people were very open and talkative while some were immediately dismissive, and I can completely relate with 
both forms of backgrounds becuase it's a matter of how they've experienced the world. What I've noticed in regards to openness
was that **more attractive women, older women (25+), and solo travelers** were the most receptive to my approaches:

**Attractive People Tend To Be Treated Better**

When I started doing approaches, I ruled out talking to girls that were taller than me for fear of failure. 
I focused instead of "safe" candidates, meaning primarily girls who I thought were around the same
level of attractiveness as me or (I apologize if I sound shallow) below how I ranked myself. To my surprise, a lot of those
girls that were on the plainer side tended to react with skepticism and suspicion when I told them that I thought they were
cute. Funnily enough, the tall girls and the very attractive girls reacted in a much more friendly way!

From my recent approaches, approach 61, a girl around 5'9", responded with "thanks, I appreciate it" when I 
said my direct line. She wasn't interested, but still acknowledged me with a smile where she could have easily brushed me
off or turned the other way without saying anything. My 64th approach, a girl who looked like an autoshow model, smiled in response,
engaging in innocent small talk for a few minutes before she excused herself. When I approached a younger girl, my 71st approach, she seemed quite intrigued at what I was doing rather than defensive. And my 76th approach,
a very awkward stumbling through of my direct line using Mandarin, surprisingly worked on such a cute girl (thank goodness).

I've read online that because attractive people get approached less since people are too intimidated to do so, they
tend to be more open when you do. This seemed to be the case for me (yay me!) but I don't think this explains it fully. 
An additional factor could be how they view the world - because people tend to treat them better, attractive people are more optimistic about
the world. Thus, when a stranger like me walks up to them and says such a blunt line, the girl responds receptively. 

**Older People Are More Secure**

Yes this is obvious, but I put this in because during my numerous walks around NYC, I see the VAST majority of women
walking around by themselves to be at least 25 years old. Whether in shopping malls, parks, or other places of interest,
there are barely any young women out and about without being in a group. 

I believe this to be the case because older people tend to care less about what others think of them, and are able to do 
what they want to do without having to find somebody to do it with. They don't mind being seen alone and are more comfortable
with being themselves, which comes with age. This is rather unfortunate and I think the best way to find girls in their early
20's is through social circles.

Going on a tangent, I've only been able to become more comfortable with myself after going through a string of failures
which I will not elaborate on here (and are unrelated to matters regarding women). Through becoming 
numb to failure and looking at it in the face day after day, I was able to learn and improve, eventually getting the result I
wanted. And that allowed me to take greater steps outside of my comfort zone, such as approach women, create content, and 
travel alone.

**Solo Travelers (A group I should work on more)**

Speaking of traveling alone, I've encountered a fair amount of women traveling by themselves and almost all of them were
open to talking. Some of them were also very attractive - my 59th approach, an older girl from Taiwan here in New York on a 
business trip, was very friendly and I went for it after seeing her look with interest at the merry-go-round at Bryant Park. 
Another girl, my 73rd approach, was a schoolteacher in Korea here visiting her cousin. Despite not even knowing English too
well, she was still engaged in the conversation we had, one in which I was a bit nervous because of how fine her face looked!

I say that I have to work on this group more because I have only been able to get a date with one of these girls that I've 
approached, and this is the group that is the most open-minded from my interactions. I can get the conversation started, but
the interaction must be "spiced up" for anything more than a conversation to happen. 

**So...get your sh*t together**

I've listed three types of people that tend to be more open to my approaches because of their state, but it's not just about
how the other person is. I have the power to influence the outcome as well and so the less of a mess my life is, the 
more confident I can be and the more success I can find. What can you do to get your sh*t together?
