description: a platonic date, it was hard to form a connection so the game is a numbers game, a deep connection is very important

Actual date: 05/19/17

After getting her FB, I messaged her the same night with some comments related to our discussion on what NYC has to offer. We texted for a bit the next day, exchanging messages here and there. I didn’t really know what to think. I assumed it wasn’t going to go anywhere so I played hard to get, responding on an infrequent basis. Perhaps taking the more hands-off approach would be better to make her feel more interested in me. 
 
To my surprise, it worked. She happened to be hanging out by herself today, and messaged me asking what’s up. I responded and we got chatting quickly, leading up to my eventual ask to meet up, which she agreed to. 
 
I headed over to Koreatown to meet her in front of a cafe. Eagerly waiting, I stood in front of the cafe glancing at the people passing by. I noticed a fashionable girl wearing tasteful and sexy makeup and lipstick walk by, and thought to myself how nice it would be to go out with her. 
 
To my surprise, she messaged me asking where I was and I said I was heading to her location. Little did I know, she was the same girl that passed by - we were both standing in front of the same place when we find out through messaging each other that we were at the same place. She was the one to recognize me and our date started from there.
 
Seeing her again in person made me very happy to be with such a pretty girl, and also a bit nervous. I did have more experience now, but I’m still more-or-less the same style of how I interact with girls in that I try to act natural. Observational, witty, and evenly tempered, I open myself up to them at the same level that they open up to me. This made it difficult for me to build up a deeper level of connection with this girl because while we did share some interests such as Asian food, we did not have that high level of conversation, perhaps due to my need to get re-acclimated to the game and also her slightly limited command of the English language.

I volunteered myself to be her tour guide for the hour to hang out with this cute girl. We walked from Koreatown to Madison Square park, and then upwards through Murray Hill back to Koreatown. In the end, she asked me what I was planning on doing and I said I was going to the gym. I could tell she was free because she said she'd be wandering around the area doing some shopping, but despite me trying to get us to talk a bit more by motioning to sit down at the Herald Square/Greeley Square park, she remained standing. Initiating a high five to mark the end of our encounter, she bade me to have fun and I said the same, parting ways.
 
Our date ultimately felt like a one-time interaction where two curious people explore more about the other person in a non-judgemental way. There was no very deep connection between us, but we were still getting to know each other better. At this point, I can’t say much about it but perhaps a second date would deepen it? I don’t feel so sure so I believe game is a numbers game, you have to find that connection to keep it up especially from meeting someone on the streets of NYC.
