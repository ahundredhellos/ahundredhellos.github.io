<h1>What I learned and what can help</h1>
	
  <h2>Data</h2>
 <p>
  I took notes on everything that I did for all to view. This is the raw data from which I extrapolate my information in writing my articles, whether it's recounding the experiences I have or providing evidence for what I've learned.

Mark Manson's book is what I believe to be the best introduction to concepts of vulnerability, outcome independence, and lifestyle in regards to "the game".

<br>
Mike Cernovich's book on mindset, a concept that is so important to get right in undertaking any endeavour. The thoughts of an awkward-turned-social, boy-to-man.

Another book by Mark Manson, this time focused more on overall lifestyle - it's about living for yourself rather than what external forces think you should live for.
