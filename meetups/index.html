	<h1>What happened after the first approach</h1>
<p>What happens after the first encounter? After getting her contact information, I try to arrange for another in-person meeting. A second chance to get to know each other better, this date sets the tone for further interactions. If there is a connection, there will be more. If not, we will probably never meet again. Regardless, all of these meetups live in my memory, to be revisited here:</p>
